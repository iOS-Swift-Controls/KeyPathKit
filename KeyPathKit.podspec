  s.description      = <<-DESC
Swift 4 has introduced a new type called KeyPath, with allows to access the properties of an object with a very nice syntax. For instance:

let string = "Foo"
let keyPathForCount = \String.count

let count = string[keyPath: keyPathForCount] // count == 3
The great part is that the syntax can be very concise, because it supports type inference and property chaining.

Consequently, I thought it would be nice to leverage this new concept in order to build an API that allows to perform data manipulation in a very declarative fashion.

SQL is a great language for such manipulations, so I took inspiration from it and implemented most of its standard operators in Swift 4 using KeyPath.

But what really stands KeyPathKit appart from the competition is its clever syntax that allows to express queries in a very seamless fashion. For instance :

contacts.filter(where: \.lastName == "Webb" && \.age < 40)
                       DESC
